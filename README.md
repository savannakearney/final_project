# final_project

## Week 1


This week I wrote out all of my basic HTML for my app, including basic html, head, body and meta tags, linking to my style sheets and JavaScript, putting in a map with markers, creating titles, text and a footnote, linking and attributing images, wrapping everything in divs for future JavaScript functions.


This week was challenging because every step took much longer than I originally expected. Although I already knew how to do the leaflet map, basic HTML and more, now I know to better plan for the time the JavaScript and CSS will take.


Next week and week 3, I will input all of the JavaScript. I've set up my HTML in a logical order so that it will be easier to write up the JavaScript. I'm definitely anticipating having some trouble with JavaScript, especially since I plan to use JQuery. After thoroughly testing everything, the next week I will make it beautiful with CSS. I'm not planning on using Boostrap for this assignment, but I may use the CSS grid that Ryan went over in class last week.


## Week 2


This week I wrote all of my JavaScript using JQuery. Before doing that, though, I linked the markers in the leaflet map (in HTML) to take the user to the part of the page that was about the city he or she clicked on. As for JQuery, I wrote functions to hide the interest categories and the text below. Then, I wrote functions to make all of the photos clickable buttons. I also wrote code to show and hide the interest category images when the main city images are clicked. Once that the user does that, if they click the interest category image, two to three paragraphs of text and heading should drop down.


This week was challenging because I was unsuccessful in making my images clickable and therefore unsuccessful in showing the content that needs to show. This was disappointing since I researched and played around with my code a lot. I also had to change and reorganize a lot of the divs I had created as containers with ids and classes. However, I was successful in hiding the content that I wanted to be hidden when the user first opens the page.


Next week, I will try to make fix my JQuery to make my app interactive. Hopefully there will be time for that after presentations in class. I will then complete the CSS to make my app beautiful. I think CSS grid will be very helpful in putting the images and text in the exact spots that I want them on the page. However, I'm a little nervous to use it because it's unfamiliar territory and may take some time to learn.
