# final_project

## Week 1


This week I wrote out all of my basic HTML for my app, including
*Basic html
*Head, body and meta tags
*Linking to my style sheets and JavaScript
*Putting in a map with markers
*Creating titles, text and a footnote
*Linking and attributing images
*Wrapping everything in divs for future JavaScript functions


This week was challenging because every step took much longer than I originally expected. Although I already knew how to do the leaflet map, basic HTML and more, now I know to better plan for the time the JavaScript and CSS will take.


Next week and week 3, I will input all of the JavaScript. I've set up my HTML in a logical order so that it will be easier to write up the JavaScript. I'm definitely anticipating having some trouble with JavaScript, especially since I plan to use JQuery. After thoroughly testing everything, the next week I will make it beautiful with CSS. I'm not planning on using Boostrap for this assignment, but I may use the CSS grid that Ryan went over in class last week.
